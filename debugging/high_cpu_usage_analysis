I have used 'htop' command to see the CPU usage during tranfer of files between server and client.
Version vsftpd_v1 takes around 8.8% CPU time for downloading a 1GB file from the server to the client while version vsftpd_v4 takes 100% of the CPU time.
Version vsftpd_v1 takes around 59% of CPU time for uploading a 1GB file to the server while version vsftpd_v4 takes 100% of the CPU time.
